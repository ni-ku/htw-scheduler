This is just a small tool for scheduling your courses.
If you are a Student at HTW Berlin you possibly find
this usefull.

This was kind of my first real program :D
This parses the website of the public course dictionary (LSF)
of HTW-Berlin and throws selected courses in a weekly schedule.

Suprisingly it still works in 2019
